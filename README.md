# odin-recipes
This is my recipe project to demonstrate what ive learned about HTML in The Odin Project so far

I made a main index.html that has an unordered list of links to 3 html pages a made that contain recipes. They each have a picture of the finished dish, an unordered list of ingredients, and ordered list(s) of instructions.
