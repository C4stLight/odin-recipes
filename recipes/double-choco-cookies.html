    <img src="../images/double-chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg" alt="close up picture of a cookie">

    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>2 Tbsp brewed espresso or strong coffee</li>
        <li>flaky sea salt (such as Maldon) <em>optional garnish</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>Instructions</em></h2>
    <h3>Stir together dry ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a smaller mixing bowl, add flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.  Whisk to combine, then set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>"Cream" the butter and sugars</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To a large mixing bowl, add the softened butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar. 
            Using a hand mixer, beat on LOW for about 30 seconds (or until the ingredients are starting to stick together), 
            then increase speed to MED and beat for about 1-2 minutes, or until everything is fully combined and lighter in color.
        <em>**This process is called creaming the fat and sugar, but there is no cream in this recipe**</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Add remaining wet ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the egg, vanilla extract, and espresso, then beat until combined.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Combine wet and dry ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To the mixing bowl with the wet ingredients, add the combined dry ingredients from the smaller bowl. 
            Beat on LOW until things are just combined and you don't see any streaks of flour.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stir in chips</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 1 3/4 cup chocolate chips (reserving the other 1/4 cup for later), and stir until combined.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chill</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare to bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Scoop dough and bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a 1.5 Tbsp cookie scoop to scoop dough, then roll into a ball with your hands. 
            Add to prepared baking sheets, adding about 8 dough balls on each baking sheet, 
            leaving about 2 inches of space between each ball.</li>
        <li>Using the remaining chocolate chips, press a few chocolate chips gently into the top of each ball.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are set but the middle still looks soft and a bit gooey.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cool</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. The cookies may look more puffed up when you remove them from the oven, 
            and sort of deflate as they cool.</li>
        <li><em>**Letting them sit on the baking sheet allows them to gently finish baking and will make sure they're not overcooked and crumbly.**</em></li>
        <li>After they've cooled on the baking sheet, remove them to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
    </ol>
